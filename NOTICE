USER SECURITY NOTICE

THE PROGRAM "typingstatd", FROM NOW ON CALLED THE DAEMON, REQUIRE ROOT ACCESS
TO RUN DUE TO THE FOLLOWING 2 (TWO) MAIN REASONS:

(1) THIS DAEMON UTILIZES A KEYLOGGER AND WILL LOG EVERYTHING TYPED ON YOUR
KEYBOARD AS LONG AS THIS DAEMON IS RUNNING. THIS POSES A SECURITY RISK IF NOT
USED PROPERLY. DATA COLLECTED BY THE DAEMON WILL BE PROCESSED AND MINIMIZED AS
MUCH AS NECESSARY TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF DATA ABOUT YOUR TYPING IS BEING
TRANSFERRED. THE NEED FOR ROOT ACCESS BOILS DOWN TO ALLOW READING KEYBOARD
EVENTS IN "/dev/input".

(2) THE DAEMON BROADCASTS INFORMATION COLLECTED ABOUT YOUR TYPING FOR THE
MAIN PROGRAM "typingstat" TO USE OVER THE NETWORK. AS LONG THE DAEMON IS USED
PROPERLY, ONLY 4 (FOUR) INTEGERS WILL BE BROADCASTED TO ANY LISTENING PROGRAM.
THEY ARE: `word_wpm` (WORDS PER MINUTE), `key_kps` (KEYS PER SECOND),
`error_percentage` (ERROR PERCENTAGE) AND `strokes` (NUMBER OF KEYPRESSES).
THESE INTEGERS WILL BE BROADCASTED ON THE NETWORK ON DEFAULT IP ADDRESS:
'localhost' AND PORT: 12345. IT IS HIGHLY DISCOURAGED TO USE A GLOBAL IP ADRESS.
THE NEED FOR ROOT HERE IS USED AS A REMINDER TO THE USER AS TO WHAT THEY HAVE
RUNNING ON THEIR SYSTEM.

CONDENSED END USER AGREEMENT

BY RUNNING THIS DAEMON WITH ROOT PRIVILIGIES YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE INFORMED
ABOUT THE RISKS INVOLVED AND THAT YOU TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY IF THE DAEMON
IS NOT USED AS INTENDED. THIS ALSO MEANS MODIFYING THE CONFIG FILE in
"~/.config/typingstat/config.py" or "/etc/typingstat/config.py".

IN THE END, THE DAEMON IS AS SAFE AS THE USER MAKES IT. GOOD LUCK!
